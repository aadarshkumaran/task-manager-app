# üìù Task Manager App ‚Äì Full Stack Project

## üöÄ How to Set Up and Run the Project

### Backend
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aadarshkumaran/task-manager-app.git
   cd task-manager-app/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend root:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

> Server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

> The app will run on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## üí° Assumptions Made

- All users must sign up and log in before accessing tasks.
- Each task is tied to a single user (`owner`).
- Categories are entered as free text for now (not selected from a fixed list).
- Tasks can be marked completed or pending only via boolean field.
- The dashboard is per-user and shows stats only for the logged-in user.
- The backend API base URL is hardcoded or handled via `.env` files.
- The user must be authenticated before accessing protected routes (e.g., dashboard, task list).
- JWT token is stored in `localStorage` and sent with each API request using `Authorization` headers.

## üßó Challenges Faced & Solutions in Backend

1. **Authentication Protection:**
   - ‚úÖ Solved by creating a reusable `authMiddleware` that checks JWT tokens and protects task routes.

2. **Task Filtering & Searching:**
   - ‚úÖ Used MongoDB's query capabilities and regex to allow flexible searching and filtering by query params.

3. **Category Summarization in Dashboard:**
   - ‚úÖ Used MongoDB aggregation to dynamically group tasks by category.

4. **Frontend Token Handling:**
   - ‚úÖ Stored token in `localStorage` and passed in `Authorization` headers via Axios interceptors or manually.

5. **Cross-Origin Requests:**
   - ‚úÖ Configured CORS middleware to allow frontend communication during development.

## üßó Challenges Faced & Solutions in Frontend

1. **Routing and Navigation:**
   - ‚úÖ Used `react-router-dom` v7 to structure public and private routes cleanly.

2. **JWT Token Management:**
   - ‚úÖ Handled token storage and sending manually via Axios headers.

3. **Responsive UI with Tailwind:**
   - ‚úÖ Used Tailwind's utility classes to ensure responsiveness across devices.

4. **State Handling for Auth & Dashboard:**
   - ‚úÖ Managed using `useEffect`, `useState`, and component props.

- Deployment-ready and uses environment variables for production safety.
- Smooth integration with backend API at `http://localhost:5000`
- Designed with scalability in mind‚Äîmodular components and routing
- Easily deployable to platforms like Vercel or Netlify
